<a href="https://repl.it/EMbd/0>Play here</a>

A game that calls out illegal moves, check and checkmate, but if you're not that great at chess - don't worry. The computer's moves are random ... for now.

Move by entering the co-ordinate of your piece and the co-ordinate of your intended move, separated by a colon, (or any other delimiter of your choice).

Practice Point: Creating classes and instantiating objects.
